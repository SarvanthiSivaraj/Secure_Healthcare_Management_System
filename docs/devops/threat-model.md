## 1. System Description

The Secure Healthcare Information & Patient Management System is a web application that manages:

- Patient registration, demographics, and visit lifecycle
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR): diagnoses, prescriptions, lab orders/results, imaging
- Staff identity, roles (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Consent management for data sharing
- Audit logging with hash-chain integrity
- Multi-organization support with staff-org mappings

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React (CRA), served via nginx in production |
| Backend API | Node.js 20 / Express |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 |
| Authentication | JWT (access + refresh tokens), bcrypt, WebAuthn/Passkeys |
| Containerization | Docker multi-stage builds, Docker Compose |
| CI | GitHub Actions |

| TB-2 | Frontend → API | DMZ → App Zone | JWT authentication, CORS, input validation |
| TB-3 | API → Database | App Zone → Data Zone | Connection pooling, parameterized queries, least-privilege DB user |
| TB-4 | API → File Storage | App Zone → Data Zone | File type validation, path traversal prevention, size limits |
