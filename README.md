# Secure Healthcare Information & Patient Management System with Regulatory Compliance

A security-first healthcare platform designed to protect sensitive medical data through patient ownership, consent-driven access, role-based authorization, and fully auditable workflows aligned with GDPR and HIPAA principles.

---

## Overview

Modern healthcare systems manage extremely sensitive data such as diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory reports, imaging results, and treatment histories. As healthcare services continue to digitize, protecting this data while ensuring controlled accessibility has become a critical engineering challenge.

This project implements a secure healthcare information and patient management system that embeds privacy, security, and regulatory considerations directly into system architecture rather than treating them as external requirements.

The platform models real-world healthcare interactions between patients, doctors, nurses, laboratories, pharmacists, administrators, insurers, and researchers while enforcing strict governance over medical data access.

The system is built on the principle that **trust in healthcare software must be engineered — not assumed.**

---

## Problem Statement

Healthcare data governance is inherently complex due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the confidential nature of medical information. Although regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA define strict requirements for handling patient data, many existing systems fail to enforce these principles at the engineering layer.

The challenge addressed in this project is to design a healthcare platform that responsibly manages sensitive medical data by embedding security, ethical, and compliance requirements directly into workflows and access control mechanisms — ensuring every data interaction is authorized, purposeful, traceable, and compliant.

## Objectives

- Establish **patient ownership** of medical data  
- Enforce a **default-deny access model**  
- Implement **consent-driven data sharing**  
- Support **role-based and context-aware authorization**  
- Maintain **immutable audit trails**  
- Ensure **compliance-ready architecture**  
- Enable secure clinical workflows  
- Build a resilient and trustworthy healthcare system
